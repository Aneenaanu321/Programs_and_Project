# Algorithm repository


A repository of algorithms for computational geometry. Curated to feature cutting-edge research, not just the most well-known, easy to find algorithms. All sources are peer reviewed and licensed CC-BY (where possible). Please let me know if you know any other suitable algorithms.

Introduction for an informative and factual blog post about the repository of algorithms for computational geometry. The aim is to provide cutting-edge research, not well known or simple to find ones; all articles are peer reviewed and licensed CC-BY (where possible). Please let me know if you know any other suitable algorithms.

##Contributing to the Repository:
It would be great for people to help improve the repository, and we welcome it. We aim to not only provide a vast range of algorithms, but also very clearly explain them in detailed information. We may even ask experienced researchers to do this.

The algorithms are written in Python, and the repository is a git repo, hosted at github.com. Contributions to the repository should be made using github's pull request mechanism.

##License:
The algorithms are licensed CC-BY (where possible). If there is no license specified in the article, it is assumed that the author wants to keep their algorithm open source. In such cases, you should instead submit a pull request for a license change with a link to your preferred CC-BY license for this algorithm.

##Contact:
To contact me, you can email me at neha@geometrictools.org, or send me a message on linkedin. I'm also available on gitter.im for questions and discussions. It would be really nice of you to say hi! :)

Thank you for reading! Please look forward to many new articles soon! :D :D :D :D ___________________________________________________________________________________
