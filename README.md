# Algorithm repository


A repository of algorithms for computational geometry.

##Contributing to the Repository:
It would be great for people to help improve the repository, and we welcome it. We aim to not only provide a vast range of algorithms, but also very clearly explain them in detailed information. We may even ask experienced researchers to do this.

The algorithms are written in Python, and the repository is a git repo, hosted at github.com. Contributions to the repository should be made using github's pull request mechanism.
